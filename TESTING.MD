The program is contructed using Python technology.
Testing was completed using [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/).

# PEP8 Validation
All modules were teseted using PEP8 Validator. Most of bugs were related to line length (> 80 characters), trailing whitspace or too few blank lines. After validation the final code in all modules were founded with no warnings.

![Expample of PEP8 result](docs/testing-files/budget-pep8-validation.png)

The file with first validation can be found [here](docs/testing-files/pep8-example-validation.txt).

# Code Validation
All users inputs are validated with third party library [PyInputPlus](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/).
The library automates validation so no further code structrue is required.

# Try/Except Function
Parts of the code required extra validation using Python built-in method *try/except*.
