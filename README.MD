## Logic flow
Logic flow was presented using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to visualize how the program will run.

## Program Structure
Personal Budget Manager is run in terminal and Google Sheets. User inputs data through selection based on menu provided or by typing. All inputs are validated for proper program operation.

### Colour
Third party library [termcolor](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/) was used to colour title heading in the terminal for enhanced UX. 

<span style="color: green">Green</span> was selected, inspired by Matrix movie.
